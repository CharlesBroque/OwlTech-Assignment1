# CS 3503 Assignment 1 - Number Base Conversion

## Author
Dylan K.

## Description
Project for CS 3503. Converts numbers into different bases and displays the results.

## Build Instructions
```Windows PowerShell
gcc -o BaseUtility main.c
.\BaseUtility.exe
```
Make sure you're not running it in a protected folder; it needs to make (and later delete) a temporary file in the middle of running.

## Test Results
100/100 tests passed

## Notes
Absolutely disgustingly difficult for a first assignment, not because of the math, but because I've never written C code before. Inside you'll find pointer management (still don't get it), file handling (barely grasped), and some hellacious workarounds for not knowing how to do things "the right way" (e.g. regular expressions). The assignment document says "we'll guide you through everything you need"--I could not concoct a bigger lie if I tried. It's barely enough to get started, and I've had no luck with instructors. But I slugged it out, and I slugged it out, and I slugged it out, and my fingers are sore from searching, and my gray matter is tender and bruised, but it's done. I hope it's what you wanted.
